ðŸ“Œ **Users By Average Session Time**
- [Question](https://platform.stratascratch.com/coding/10352-users-by-avg-session-time?code_type=3): Calculate each user's average session time. A session is defined as the time difference between a page_load and page_exit. For simplicity, assume a user has only 1 session per day and if there are multiple of the same events on that day, consider only the latest page_load and earliest page_exit. Output the user_id and their average session time.


**Method 1:**
```sql
WITH user_activity_cte AS(
    SELECT
        DATE(timestamp), 
        user_id,
        MAX(CASE WHEN action = 'page_load' THEN timestamp END) AS page_load_time,
        MIN(CASE WHEN action = 'page_exit' THEN timestamp END) AS page_exit_time
    FROM
        facebook_web_log
    GROUP BY 1,2)
SELECT
user_id,
    AVG(TIMESTAMPDIFF(second,page_load_time,page_exit_time)) AS timediff
FROM 
    user_activity_cte 
GROUP BY 1;
```
**Method 2:**

```SQL
WITH max_timestamp AS(
    SELECT
        user_id,
        DATE(timestamp) AS date_part, 
        MAX(timestamp) AS max_page_load
    FROM
        facebook_web_log
    WHERE
        action = 'page_load'
    GROUP BY 1,2),
min_timestamp AS(
    SELECT
        user_id,
        DATE(timestamp) AS date_part , 
        MIN(timestamp) AS min_page_exit
    FROM
    facebook_web_log
    WHERE
        action = 'page_exit'
    GROUP BY 1,2)
SELECT
T.user_id,
    AVG(TIME_TO_SEC(TIMEDIFF(min_page_exit,max_page_load))) AS timediff
FROM 
    max_timestamp T JOIN min_timestamp mt ON T.user_id=mt.user_id
    AND  T.date_part=mt.date_part
GROUP by 1;
```

- [Question](https://platform.stratascratch.com/coding/10322-finding-user-purchases?code_type=3): Write a query that'll identify returning active users. A returning active user is a user that has made a second purchase within 7 days of any other of their purchases. Output a list of user_ids of these returning active users.

```SQL
WITH next_date_cte AS(
        SELECT 
            user_id, 
            created_at,
            LEAD(created_at) OVER(PARTITION BY  user_id ORDER BY created_at) AS second_purchase
        FROM amazon_transactions
)
SELECT 
    DISTINCT user_id 
FROM
    next_date_cte
WHERE DATEDIFF(second_purchase,created_at) <= 7;

ðŸ“Œ **Acceptance Rate By Date**
- [Question](https://platform.stratascratch.com/coding/10285-acceptance-rate-by-date?code_type=3): What is the overall friend acceptance rate by date? Your output should have the rate of acceptances by the date the request was sent. Order by the earliest date to latest.
Assume that each friend request starts by a user sending (i.e., user_id_sender) a friend request to another user (i.e., user_id_receiver) that's logged in the table with action = 'sent'. If the request is accepted, the table logs action = 'accepted'. If the request is not accepted, no record of action = 'accepted' is logged.

```SQL
SELECT 
  date,
  SUM(ACCEPT_ACTION)/SUM(SENT_ACTION) AS percentage_acceptance
FROM(
    SELECT 
        user_id_sender, 
        user_id_receiver,
        MIN(DATE) AS DATE,
        SUM(CASE WHEN ACTION = 'sent' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS SENT_ACTION,
        SUM(CASE WHEN ACTION = 'accepted' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS ACCEPT_ACTION
    FROM fb_friend_requests
    GROUP BY 1,2) base
GROUP BY 1
```

Output the rank, guest id, and number of total messages they've sent. Order by the highest number of total messages first.

        id_guest,
        SUM(n_messages) AS sum_n_messages
    FROM airbnb_contacts
    GROUP BY 1) base;

ðŸ“Œ **Marketing Campaign Success [Advanced]**

- [Question](https://platform.stratascratch.com/coding/514-marketing-campaign-success-advanced?code_type=3): You have a table of in-app purchases by user. Users that make their first in-app purchase are placed in a marketing campaign where they see call-to-actions for more in-app purchases. Find the number of users that made additional in-app purchases due to the success of the marketing campaign.
The marketing campaign doesn't start until one day after the initial in-app purchase so users that only made one or multiple purchases on the first day do not count, nor do we count users that over time purchase only the products they purchased on the first day.


```SQL
WITH initial_purches_cte AS(
SELECT *,
        DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY created_at) rank_by_order,
        DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY user_id, product_id ORDER BY created_at) rank_by_product
    FROM marketing_campaign)
SELECT
    COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) total_users
FROM
initial_purches_cte
WHERE rank_by_order > 1 AND rank_by_product = 1;
```
